# v0.1.0 — Initial release

`awesome-llm-memory` launches with a quality-first curation baseline for LLM/agent memory.

## Highlights
- 70 structured entries (Paper/Repo/Benchmark/Dataset)
- Mandatory cornerstone works included (MemGPT, Letta, A-MEM, RET-LLM, MemoryLLM, Generative Agents, RMT, graph memory survey)
- Starter paths for Researcher / Builder / Product
- Taxonomy docs + contribution standards
- Automation: link lint, duplicate checks, README builder, CI
- Scheduled auto-update workflow (seed awesome lists + arXiv scan -> PR)

## Notes
This repo is best-effort curation. It reduces discovery friction, not quality guarantees.

## Changelog
See `CHANGELOG.md`.
